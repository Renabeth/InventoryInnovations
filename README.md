## Overview
Inventory Innovations is an inventory management system for restaurants coded in C++. Users can log-in as a Member or an Admin. Employees can view the inventory, purchase products/update the inventory, view budget, and view previous transactions. However employees can only buy products related to what department they work in. Admins have the same permissions as Members and in addition can set funds for each department. For the sake of demonstration, the log-in information can be viewed in the Users.txt file.
